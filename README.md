# DemoStreamings
Demo Streamings is a task for Stan's Coding Challenge.

## Setup
* install NodeJS
* install Sass 
* install React, WebPack, Babel, React Router, Sass Loader, Hot Loader, Jest with npm
* run npm start
* open http://localhost:8080 in browser.

## Run production version
* copy dist to the webroot on your server
* open http://localhost/dist in browser.

## How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?
* Webpack is used for packing up the code
* Babel is used for transfering ES6, React JSX to browser compatible js code
* Sass is used to preprocess and organize the CSS code

## Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
* Some styling is not looking good, could be improved
* The code could be organized in a better structure

## What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
* I'll use Redux for managing the state
